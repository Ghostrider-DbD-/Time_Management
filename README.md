# Time_Management
This is a simple addon that provides the ability to do two things:
1. Determine time of day at server startup.
2. Specify time acceleration to be used for daytime, nightime and evenings.

Installation:
Adjust values in the config to suite your needs.
Pack the timeManagement folder
Either put this folder in some other folder you wish to have loaded on server startup (@epochhive\addons; @ExileServer\addons) or add it as an addon loaded by the server as -serverMod=@timeManagement
